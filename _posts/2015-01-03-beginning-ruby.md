*Ruby - Where to begin?*

I want to make this resource as useful as possible to as many people as possible, and I realized after discussing it with my Father, who is a software engineer that
doesn't know Ruby, that it might be a good idea to 1) Offer a list of decent resources for learning Ruby, and 2) Potentially start a beginner series of my own at
some point that can serve as a crash course for learning Ruby when you're already an engineer. To start though, I'll offer a small list of good resources.

* [Ruby Quick Start - requires Ruby and IRB(comes with Ruby)](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
* [Try Ruby - Interactive Online Tutorial - iuns Interactive Ruby remotely](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
* [Learn Ruby the Hard way - part of the 'learn the hard way' programming series](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)
* [Programming Ruby - The Pragmatic Programmers Guide - One of my favorites, also known as "the pickaxe" and the definitive Ruby guide](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)

After you're a little more accustomed to the language:

* [Awesome Ruby - amazing list of Ruby resources, frameworks, libraries, and utilities](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby)

There are plenty of other great tutorials out there, and if you think you have one that deserves to be in this list, please leave a link in the comments and I'll review it.
