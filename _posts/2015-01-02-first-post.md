### Welcome to Confluent Coding!

This is the first of what I hope to be many entries on this blog. I chose the name confluent because I want this blog to represent the joining of ideas, creativity, and information,
and I'm not sure a better word exists to represent that.
This project began because I needed a companion to go with my long term project of building a repository of design patterns, C extensions, and unit testing in Ruby.
At work we occasionally have a 'hack Friday' where we all take a day to try to think of and implement something creative or useful that's not part of our regular work.
It's a great way to let off steam and get to work with people on different teams that you don't get to work with as often.
This led to me teaching a group of junior engineers twice a week about Ruby, Design Patterns, and how to architect sustainable systems. The classes are going well,
but I started thinking of ways that I could help them continue to retain information, and the answer was simple: tutorial series for each one of the concepts we cover
in the classes. Hopefully this will be helpful not only to them, but anyone else out there looking to learn! Check back soon, I'll be starting with the Command Pattern.
